            <p style="font-size:100%;">I am an Assistant Professor in the department of Computer Science at Vanderbilt University. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of Virginia,  under the supervision of  Prof. <a href="https://engineering.virginia.edu/faculty/john-stankovic" target="_blank" style = "color: #236B8E;"> John A. Stankovic</a> and Prof. <a href="https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~lufeng/" target="_blank" style = "color: #236B8E;"> Lu Feng.</a> </br>
              My research is at the intersection of Machine learning, Formal Methods, and Cyber-Physical Systems. Specifically, my work integrates Formal Methods and Machine Learning, and apply them to build safe, robust and reliable Cyber-Physical Systems, especially in areas of Smart Cities and Healthcare. </br>
              Here is my <a href="CV_MeiyiMa.pdf"  download="" style = "color: #236B8E;">[CV]</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=d39BOU4AAAAJ" target="_blank" style = "color: #236B8E;">[Google Scholar]</a>. 
              
              <h4 style="font-size:1em"> I am looking for self-motivated Ph.D. students. Please send me your CV and research statement if you are interested in working with me.</h4>
