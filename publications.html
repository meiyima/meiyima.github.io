                We present SaSTL---a novel Spatial Aggregation Signal Temporal Logic---for the efficient runtime monitoring of safety and performance requirements in smart cities.
                We first describe a study of over 1,000 smart city requirements, some of which can not be specified using existing logic such as Signal Temporal Logic (STL) and its variants. 
                To tackle this limitation, we develop two new logical operators in SaSTL to augment STL for expressing spatial aggregation and spatial counting characteristics that are commonly found in real city requirements. 
                We also develop efficient monitoring algorithms that can check a SaSTL requirement in parallel over multiple data streams (e.g., generated by multiple sensors distributed spatially in a city).
                We evaluate our SaSTL monitor by applying to two case studies with large-scale real city sensing data (e.g., up to 10,000 sensors in one requirement). The results show that SaSTL has a much higher coverage expressiveness than other spatial-temporal logics, and with a significant reduction of computation time for monitoring requirements. 
                We also demonstrate that the SaSTL monitor can help improve the safety and performance of smart cities via simulated experiments. </div>

               Cities are deploying tens of thousands of sensors and actuators and developing a large array of smart services. The smart services use sophisticated models and decision-making policies supported by Cyber Physical Systems and Internet of Things technologies. The increasing number of sensors collects a large amount of city data across multiple domains. The collected data have great potential value, but has not yet been fully exploited. This survey focuses on the domains of transportation, environment, emergency and public safety, energy, and social sensing. This article carefully reviews both the data sets being collected across 14 smart cities and the state-of-the-art work in modeling and decision making methodologies. The article also points out the characteristics, challenges faced today, and those challenges that will be exacerbated in the future. Key data issues addressed include heterogeneity, interdisciplinary, integrity, completeness, real-timeliness, and interdependencies. Key decision making issues include safety and service conflicts, security, uncertainty, humans in the loop, and privacy. </div>

           Resolution of conflicts across services in smart cities is an important yet challenging problem. We present CityResolver - a decision support system for conflict resolution in smart cities. CityResolver uses an Integer Linear Programming based method to generate a small set of resolution options, and a Signal Temporal Logic based verification approach to compute these resolution options' impact on city performance. The trade-offs between resolution options are shown in a dashboard to support decision makers in selecting the best resolution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CityResolver by comparing the performance with two baselines: a smart city without conflict resolution, and CityGuard which uses a priority rule-based conflict resolution. Experimental results show that CityResolver can reduce the number of requirement violations and improve the city performance significantly.

           With the increasing number of smart services implemented in smart cities, it is important yet challenging to dynamically detect service conflicts with respect to safety and performance requirements. In this paper, we propose a framework for monitoring the operation of smart cities and services at runtime. We formalize a set of typical safety and performance requirements from different domains in smart cities (e.g., transportation, emergency, and environment) using Signal Temporal Logic. We present a case study based on a smart city simulator, in which actions of smart services and their predicted effects on city states are converted into signal traces over time and monitored continuously using formal specifications. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of using runtime monitoring to detect various conflicts of smart services.

           Research in the area of internet-of-things, cyberphysical-systems, and smart health often employ sensor systems at residences for continuous monitoring. Such research-oriented residential monitoring systems (RRMSs) usually face two major challenges, long-term reliable operation management and validation of system functionality with minimal human effort. Targeting these two challenges, this paper describes a monitor of monitoring systems with ground-truth validation capabilities, M 2 G. It consists of two subsystems, the Monitor 2 system and the Ground-truth validation system. The Monitor 2 system encapsulates a flexible set of general-purpose components to monitor the operation and connectivity of heterogeneous sensor devices (e.g. smart watches, smart phones, microphones, beacons, etc.), a local base-station, as well as a cloud server. It provides a user-friendly interface and supports different types of RRMSs in various contexts. The system also features a ground truth validation system to support obtaining ground truth in the field. Additionally, customized alerts can be sent to remote administrators and other personnel to report any dysfunction or inaccuracy of the system in real time. M 2 G is applied to three very different case studies: the M2FED system which monitors family eating dynamics [1], an in-home wireless sensing system for monitoring nighttime agitation [2], and the BESI system which monitors behavioral and environmental parameters to predict health events and to provide interventions [3]. The results indicate that M 2 G is a comprehensive system that (i) requires small cost in time and effort to adapt to an existing RRMS, (ii) provides reliable data collection and reduction in data loss by detecting faults in real-time, and (iii) provides a convenient and timely ground truth validation facility.

           Nowadays, increasing number of smart services are being developed and deployed in cities around the world. IoT platforms have emerged to integrate smart city services and city resources, and thus improve city performance in the domains of transportation, emergency, environment, public safety, etc. Despite the increasing intelligence of smart services and the sophistication of platforms, the safety issues in smart cities are not addressed adequately, especially the safety issues arising from the integration of smart services. Therefore, CityGuard, a safety-aware watchdog architecture is developed. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first architecture that detects and resolves conflicts among actions of different services considering both safety and performance requirements. Prior to developing CityGuard, safety and performance requirements and a spectrum of conflicts are specified. Sophisticated models are used to analyze secondary effects, and detect device and environmental conflicts. A simulation based on New York City is used for the evaluation. The results show that CityGuard (i) identifies unsafe actions and thus helps to prevent the city from safety hazards, (ii) detects and resolves two major types of conflicts, i.e., device and environmental conflicts, and (iii) improves the overall city performance.

          Conflicting health information is a primary barrier of self-management of chronic diseases. Increasing number of people now rely on mobile health apps and online health websites to meet their information needs and often receive conflicting health advice from these sources. This problem is more prevalent and severe in the setting of multi-morbidities. In addition, often medical information can be conflicting with regular activity patterns of an individual.

In this work, we formulate the problem of finding conflicts in heterogeneous health applications including health websites, health apps, online drug usage guidelines, and daily activity logging applications. We develop a comprehensive taxonomy of conflicts based on the semantics of textual health advice and activities of daily living. Finding conflicts in health applications poses its own unique lexical and semantic challenges. These include large structural variation between pairs of textual advice, finding conceptual overlap between pairs of advice, inferring the semantics of an advice (i.e., what to do, why and how) and activities, and aligning activities suggested in advice with the activities of daily living based on their underlying dependencies and polarity. Hence, we develop Preclude2, a novel semantic rule-based solution to detect conflicts in activities and health advice derived from heterogeneous sources. Preclude2 utilizes linguistic rules and external knowledge bases to infer advice. In addition, Preclude2 considers personalization and context-awareness while detecting conflicts. We evaluate Preclude2 using 1156 real advice statements covering 8 important health topics, 90 online drug usage guidelines, 1124 online disease specific health advice covering 34 chronic diseases, and 2 activity datasets. The evaluation is personalized based on 34 real prescriptions. Preclude2 detects direct, conditional, sub-typical, quantitative, and temporal conflicts from 2129 advice statements with 0.91, 0.83, 0.98, 0.85 and 0.98 recall, respectively. Overall, it results in 0.88 recall for detecting inter advice conflicts and 0.89 recall for detecting activityâadvice conflicts. We also demonstrate the effects of personalization and context-awareness in conflict detection from heterogeneous health applications.

          With the rapid digitalization of the health sector, people often turn to mobile apps and online health websites for health advice. Health advice generated from different sources can be conflicting as they address different aspects of health (e.g., weight loss, diet, disease) or as they are unaware of the context of a user (e.g., age, gender, physiological condition). Conflicts can occur due to lexical features, (such as, negation, antonyms, or numerical mismatch) or can be conditioned upon time and/or physiological status. We formulate the problem of finding conflicting health advice and develop a comprehensive taxonomy of conflicts. While a similar research area in the natural language processing domain explores the problem of textual contradiction identification, finding conflicts in health advice poses its own unique lexical and semantic challenges. These include large structural variation between text and hypothesis pairs, finding conceptual overlap between pairs of advice, and inference of the semantics of an advice (i.e., what to do, why and how). Hence, we develop Preclude, a novel semantic rule-based solution to detect conflicting health advice derived from heterogeneous sources utilizing linguistic rules and external knowledge bases. As our solution is interpretable and comprehensive, it can guide users towards conflict resolution too. We evaluate Preclude using 1156 real advice statements covering 8 important health topics that are collected from smart phone health apps and popular health websites. Preclude results in 90% accuracy and outperforms the accuracy and F1 score of the baseline approach by about 1.5 times and 3 times, respectively.

           The populations of large cities around the world are growing rapidly. Cities are beginning to address this problem by implementing significant sensing and actuation infrastructure and building services on this infrastructure. However, as the density of sensing and actuation increases and as the complexities of services grow there is an increasing potential for conflicts across Smart City services. These conflicts can cause unsafe situations and disrupt the benefits that the services were originally intended to provide. Although some of the conflicts can be detected and avoided during designing the services, many can still occur unpredictably during runtime. This paper carefully defines and enumerates the main issues regarding the detection and resolution of runtime conflicts in smart cities. In particular, it focuses on conflicts that arise across services. This issue is becoming more and more important as Smart City designs attempt to integrate services from different domains (transportation, energy, public safety, emergency, medical, and many others). Research challenges are identified and then addressed that deal with uncertainty, dynamism, real-time, mobility and spatio-temporal availability, duration and scale of effect, efficiency, and ownership. A watchdog architecture is also described that oversees the services operating in a Smart City. This watchdog solution detects and resolves conflicts, it learns and adapts, and it provides additional inputs to decision making aspects of services. Using data from a Smart City dataset, an emulated set of services and activities using those services are created to perform a conflict analysis. A second analysis hypothesizes 41 future services across 5 domains. Both of these evaluations demonstrate the high probability of conflicts in smart cities of the future.

          Despite the increasing intelligence of smart services and sophistication of IoT platforms, the safety issues in smart cities are not addressed adequately, especially the safety issues arising from the integration of smart services. Therefore, in this demo abstract, we present CityGuard, a safety-aware watchdog architecture to detect conflicts among actions of heterogeneous services considering both safety and performance requirements. This demo simulates parts of New York City to depict how CityGuard identifies unsafe actions and thus helps to prevent the city from safety hazards, detects two major types of conflicts, i.e., device and environmental conflicts, and improves the overall city performance in terms of multiple performance metrics. This demo complements the full paper on CityGuard that appears in this conference.

           Textual health advice generated from different online sources (e.g., health apps and websites) can be conflicting. Conflicts can occur due to lexical features, (such as, negation, antonyms, or numerical mismatch) or can be conditioned upon time and/or physiological status. Detecting conflicts from textual health advice poses several challenges, including, large structural variation between text and hypothesis pairs, finding conceptual overlap between pairs of advice, and inference of the semantics of an advice (i.e., what to do, why, and how). In this demonstration, we present a semantic rule-based system to detect different types of conflicts in online textual health advice statements in a context-aware and interpretable manner.
